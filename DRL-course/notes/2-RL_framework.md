## Monte Carlo method

We can use the monte Carlo method to estimate the action value function.
The Monte Carlo methods is using randomness to solve the **prediction problem**.

**Prediction Problem**: Given a policy, how might the agent estimate the value function for that policy?

#### MC Prediction

* An algorithm that solves the prediciton problem and determine the value function $v_{\pi} (\text{or } q_{\pi})$ corresponding to a policy $\pi$.
* 

This is done by using a Q-table:

| States/actions | action 1. | action 2. | action 3. |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| State 1.       |           |           |           |
| State 2.       |           |           |           |
| State 3.       |           |           |           |
