## Future reading

1. https://github.com/createamind/DRL

   - Good papers on "new" (or in my case new) DRL techniques.

2. https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro2.html

   - An inside in different methods

3. https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii

   * It's hard to say Deep reinforcement learning without saying deepminds.

4. Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic (TD3) policy gradient

   * Paper:[ Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf)
