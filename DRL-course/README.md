## Future reading

1. https://github.com/createamind/DRL

   - Good papers on "new" (or in my case new) DRL techniques.

2. https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro2.html

   - An inside in different methods

3. https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii

   * It's hard to say Deep reinforcement learning without saying deepminds.

## Questions to tutor

* Why is policy gradient methods better? 
  * I really like the adaptive noise idea!
* Silly question, but why is it called a policy now and a agent earlier?
* Show code: How do we toggle between gradient decent and ascent?
