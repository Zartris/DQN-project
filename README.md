# Deep reinforcement learning - projects
This is my course repository, where I put my notes on each subject within reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning.
Within the DRL-course folder, you find all the small projects I have solved and a note folder.
The note folder is for the notes I use to remember and foremost to better learn the underlying subjects.

Feel free to read the notes and take inspiration, but if you do i cannot promis how beautiful it looks unless you use [Typora]( https://www.typora.io/ ) since this is what i wrote them in.
The notes are mainly from the course Deep reinforcement learning nanodegree from udacity, but also the book "[Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-reinforcement-learning)"
I would highly recommend this book as it is both very informing, but also entertaining to read. So give this a chance and you won't regret it.
