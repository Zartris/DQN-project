## Questions for next session:

1. What is MAXSQN 
   * guess max soft(soft Q learning) Q-network or maybe S is for Stochastic??? I don't know.
   * I found somewhere in Japanese a description: maxsqn is based on Q-value estimation algorithm, combining double-Q learning and entropy regularization (SQL, soft Q learning ).
     * But I cannot find any papers about it

## Future reading

1. https://github.com/createamind/DRL

   - Good papers on "new" (or in my case new) DRL techniques.

2. https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro2.html

   - An inside in different methods

     

## Library for good links and papers

This is more of a space if I think it is relevant to save a link for future use :)
