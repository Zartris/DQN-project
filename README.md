# Deep reinforcement learning - projects
This is my course repository, where I put my notes on each subject within reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning.
Within the DRL-course folder, you find all the small projects I have solved and a note folder.
The note folder is for the notes I use to remember and foremost to better learn the underlying subjects.

Feel free to read the notes and take inspiration.
The notes are mainly from the course Deep reinforcement learning nanodegree from udacity, but also the book "[Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-reinforcement-learning)"
I would highly recommend this book as it is both very informing, but also entertaining to read. So give this a chance and you won't regret it.
